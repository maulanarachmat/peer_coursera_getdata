# About Data
This data is form the experiments that have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers people wihtin age range of 19-48 years.Each person performed six activities wearing smartphone on the waist. 
The six activities that have been performed are:
1. Walking
2. Walking_Upstairs
3. Walking_Downstairs
6. Sitting
7. Standing
8. Laying

Using the smartphone, we record the data from its embedded accelerometer (Acc) and gyroscope (Gyro) on the 3-axial signals. As the accelerometer signal have body motion (Body) and gravitational (Gravity) signal, they were separated.

Furthermore, from the Body linear accelaration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (BodyAccJerk and BodyGyroJerk).

These data were obtained on time domain (t) and frequecy domain (f) which the results of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) that was applied on some signals
